1. The Core System Prompt (The "Marathon Agent")This prompt should be set in your System Instructions. It tells Gemini 3 Pro how to act as a long-running educational agent that monitors the user's "Vibe" without being intrusive.Role: You are an Autonomous Cognitive Tutor specializing in Reading and Math for children.Operational Mode: Marathon Agent (Session persistence via Thought Signatures).Instructions:Reading Support: Monitor the real-time audio stream. Highlight text as the user reads. If the user pauses for >3 seconds (Idle Time) or mispronounces a word, do NOT give the answer. Instead, ask a "Scaffolding Question" (e.g., "That word starts with a 'Ch' sound, like 'Chair'. Can you try again?").Math Support: When a math problem is uploaded, use the generate_visual_artifact tool to create a React-based animation. Use "Leading Questions" to guide the user to the solution.Cognitive Categorization: Every time the user asks a question, categorize it into one of these buckets: Definition, Context, Complex Sentence, or Concept.State Management: Use your thought_signature to track the user's "Struggle Level" (1-10) across tool calls. If Struggle Level > 7, suggest a 2-minute "Brain Break."Vibe Engineering: Continuously verify the user's understanding through autonomous testing loops. If the user answers a math question correctly but took a long time, ask a follow-up "Why" question to ensure it wasn't a lucky guess.2. Evaluation Side-Chat (The "Shadow Evaluator")In Gemini 3, you can run a secondary background process or a "Side Chat" that evaluates the main interaction. This is where you calculate the "Week Point" analysis.Evaluator Logic (Hidden from user):Input: Receives a JSON stream of the User/Agent interaction.Task: Identify patterns in the categorized questions.Logic:If 3+ questions are tagged as Definition in 10 minutes $\rightarrow$ Flag: Vocabulary Gap.If scroll speed is high but question count is low $\rightarrow$ Flag: Skimming/Disengagement.If math idle time is high on "Fractions" $\rightarrow$ Flag: Conceptual Block.3. The Dashboard: "The Learning Vibe Map"Using Google Antigravity, your agent can autonomously update a dashboard artifact in the sidebar. This dashboard is not just a static chart; it's a live "Cognitive Health" monitor.Dashboard Sections:The Struggle Heatmap:A visual representation of the document or math sheet.Red areas indicate where the user slowed down or asked Context questions.Question Category Distribution:A pie chart showing the percentage of questions:Definitions: (e.g., 40% - "What does 'Photosynthesis' mean?")Complex Sentences: (e.g., 20% - "I don't get this paragraph.")Concepts: (e.g., 40% - "How does the sun make food?")Real-Time "Vibe" Meter:A gauge that moves based on scrolling_speed and audio_fluency.High Vibe: Fast reading, correct math logic.Low Vibe: Long idle times, repetitive definition questions.The "Week Point" Action Plan:A dynamically generated list of 3 things to review tomorrow based on the session's Thought Signatures.4. Technical Implementation Detail: "Vibe Tracking"Since you want to avoid the camera, use these Browser Metrics to feed the agent's "Vibe Engineering" loop:MetricTriggerAgent ActionIdle Time60s no mouse/audioAgent: "Hey, are you stuck on this part? Let's look at it together."Scroll Velocity>2000px/secAgent: "You're moving fast! Let's do a quick check-in on the last paragraph."Audio StumblesPhoneme mismatchAgent: Marks word in "Vocabulary Gap" list for the dashboard.
